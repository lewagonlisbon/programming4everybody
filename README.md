## Welcome!

This repository contains all the files you'll see during the live sessions of the course Programming for Everybody hosted by [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com). Welcome aboard! üéâ

Please star the repository, or just bookmark the page in your favourite browser.

## Usage

Each file you see in this repository will be filled by a teacher during the corresponding session.

You will also find a `test` folder in your repository. **Don't edit or delete any file outside this folder**: it's always important to keep your personal experiments in a separate place! üß™

## Setup

**N.B:** This is an online learning series, and our teachers won't be able to help you with your computer configuration. If you are just moving your first steps, please **[stick to a REPL](#repl)**. Do you want to configure your computer like a pro? [Learn how to do it with us](#going-further)!

### REPL

If you decded to use a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), you can [create an account on Repl.it](https://repl.it/signup) (you can also use your GitHub to sign up).

Once you are logged in, click this button üëâ [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/lewagonlisbon/programming4everybody)](https://repl.it/@lewagonlisbon/programming4everybody) and select `fork` to save a copy of this repository in your personal REPLs collection.

### Git and Ruby

If you already have a GitHub profile, [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) installed, you can fork the repository and fetch the new updates after each session.

First, fork this repository to your profile.

![](images/fork.png)

Open your terminal and run the following commands one at a time (always read the comments! üëÄ):

```sh
# TODO: change with your github username
GITHUB_USERNAME="gabrielecanepa"

# Check git and ruby version:
git --version # should be >= 1.7
ruby --version # should be >= 2.2

# Create a new folder to keep your projects:
[ ! -d ~/code ] && mkdir ~/code
[ ! -d ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME ] && mkdir ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME

# Clone the repository and add the upstream (run JUST ONCE):
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/programming4everybody.git
cd programming4everybody
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lewagonlisbon/programming4everybody.git

# Open the repository with your favourite editor:
atom . # Atom
subl . # Sublime Text
code . # Visual Studio Code
```

Follow the lesson on your editor and play around in the [`test`](./test) folder.

After each session, you can get the latest updates with:

```sh
git pull upstream master
```
